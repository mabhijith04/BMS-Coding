The strength of a pair integer sequences is defined by the number of integers that they have in common. You are required to find the strength of several pairs of integer sequences. 

INPUT
The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case contains 3 lines. The first line contains two integers N and M, which are the lengths of the two sequences. The next two lines contain the sequences. 

OUTPUT
This should contain T lines, each containing an integer representing the strength of the pair of sequences for the corresponding test case. 

CONSTRAINTS
The length of each sequence will be between 1 and 20 inclusive
A sequence can contain an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive
Sequences will not contain duplicate integers
